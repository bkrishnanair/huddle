journal for keeping track of daily dev changes :
**Today's Development (2025-08-03):**

LoginScreen.js` and `SignUpScreen.js` with basic UI and form validation.
- Integrated Firebase Authentication using `@react-native-firebase/auth`.
- Implemented sign-up with `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`.
- Implemented login with `signInWithEmailAndPassword`.
- Added basic error handling using `Alert`.
- Created `AppNavigator.js` using `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/stack` to handle navigation based on authentication state.
- Modified `App.tsx` to initialize Firebase and use the `AppNavigator`.
- Configured Android project to work with Firebase by adding the `google-services` plugin dependency to `android/build.gradle` and applying the plugin to `android/app/build.gradle`.
- Added Firebase Authentication dependency (`firebase-auth`) to `android/app/build.gradle` using the Firebase BoM.
- Skipped iOS setup for now to focus on Android.
- Ran the app on Android after placing the `google-services.json` file in `android/app`.


- Fixed a RedBox error related to Firebase initialization in `/home/user/huddle/App.tsx`. The fix involved removing the empty object `{}` from the `firebase.initializeApp()` call, allowing the library to automatically pick up configuration from `google-services.json`.
- Addressed a persistent RedBox error showing a misleading Cloud Storage message. The issue was identified as a configuration problem in the Firebase console, not in the code.
- Enabled the Email/Password sign-in method in the Firebase project's Authentication settings via the Firebase Console. This was the root cause of the "permission denied" error when attempting to use authentication functions.
- Confirmed that no code changes were required for the second fix; only a configuration update in the Firebase console was needed.
- Verified the fixes by reloading the app on the emulator.

git remote add origin`, `git branch -M main`, and `git push -u origin main`.
- Addressed a blank white screen issue after fixing the RedBox error.
- Identified the cause of the blank screen as the app rendering `null` while waiting for asynchronous processes, specifically related to React Navigation initialization.
- Installed the missing dependency `react-native-gesture-handler` using `npm install react-native-gesture-handler`.
- Imported `react-native-gesture-handler` in `index.js` to ensure it loads at the app's start.
- Initially attempted to fix a native configuration issue for `react-native-gesture-handler` in `MainActivity.kt`, but this approach was based on older React Native versions.
- Correctly resolved the blank screen issue by wrapping the `AppNavigator` component with `GestureHandlerRootView` in `App.tsx

this a text file where i want to keep journal of whatever i implemented/ build for this app on the particular days in a clear, concise and simple manner. i will provide you mt chat woth ai code agent use that infor to create journal for todays development.
